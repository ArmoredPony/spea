# What
This is an implementation of SPEA2 genetic algorithm for finding or
approximating the Pareto-optimal set for multiobjective optimization problems.
Written in Rust.

Roadmap:
- [ ] test correctness of the library
- [ ] parallelize the algorithm
- [ ] stabilize the API
- [ ] add more examples
- [ ] write documentation and "howto"
- [ ] publish on crates.io

This project is in pre-alpha stage. Although it is already capable of solving
the simplest tasks of multi-purpose optimization, it should not be used in any
projects yet.
